# Unsupervised Learning: Anomaly Detection & Clustering

## Overview

In this project, I explore unsupervised learning techniques to detect anomalies and cluster data. The project includes:

- **Correlation Analysis**: Identifying relationships between variables.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Using Isolation Forest and PCA to find outliers.
- **Clustering**: Grouping similar data points with DBSCAN.

The goal is to analyze patterns in the dataset and identify any anomalies or natural groupings.

## Methods Used

1. **Correlation Analysis**: To understand how features relate to each other.
2. **Isolation Forest**: To detect outliers in the data.
3. **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: To reduce data dimensionality and highlight anomalies.
4. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**: To cluster data points based on density.

## Conclusion

Through these methods, I analyze and understand the underlying structure of the data, identifying key patterns and anomalies.
